The scribes of the Evergreen are an order unlike any other. From the warring house of the Accecia to the frozen lands of the Glade. The Scribes of the Evergreen are well renowned for their unchallenged knowledge. they are Wise, just, and often act as advisors in times of crisis. Their order is 1000 strong. They are master architects, healers, weaponsmiths, record keepers, philosophers and many other studies. The leader, Archmage Rellen is the wisest of them all, his family the Rellen clan has held the protection and safekeeping of the Evergreen. Legend has it, the Rellen family once abandoned by their village, settled by the tree, the youngest daughter and the eldest son took notice of the tree and its beauty. And cared for it, made sure it was well kept and maintained its beauty. Soon after, the Rellen family as a whole came together to care for the tree, and the middle child, Ethan upheld an oath to protect the tree, and soon the tradition of The Three was made. The Youngest Daughter, Madison would be the caretaker of the tree, Ethan the defender, and the eldest son, Alvis was the smartest of his family, he enjoyed reading  and so one day while studying about medicine to heal his sickly mother and the travelers they met on the road, the Evergreen revealed its true power. With its blessings the Rellen children were blessed, while their mother was healed. Madison was given special healing powers unmatched by any throughout the realm, Ethan unmatched strength and bravery, and Alvis was granted the Eye of the Evergreen, the ability to see past anyones facade or outer face and see the true ambitions of a person’s character, doing so allowed him to see who is to be trusted and who is not.  The Evergreen spoke and told that in its past life it was a scholar, a warrior, and a healer and seeing the golden hearts of the Rellen family offered to pass down its teachings to them. And to this day, the Rule of Three maintains the trees integrity. The Scribes of the Evergreen hold no allegiance, but offer knowledge and guidance to all. And what stands at the forefront of protecting such knowledge? Sadly Ethan had passed away protecting the his sibilings and the tree from an order known as the Bramble, but the Evergreen took his sacrifice as memory and every knight who wishes to be blessed by the Evergreen must uphold the lifelong oath, known to the scribes as Ethan’s Promise to protect the scribes and protect the knowledge gathered by the trees followers. Alvis and Madison maintained their legacy and to this day their descendants hold the knowledge they were taught to the younger generations and young scribes so that they may too bring light and wisdom to the world. 
As tradition, those pledged of Ethan’s Promise must hold no allegiance to any house, and must pass the Eye of Evergreen passed down from each generation of Alvis’s eldest born. After such, they are sworn to protect the tree and in doing so are granted the Evergreen’s blessing. Bravery, Courage, and strength that nearly matching of Ethan.  
The Knights of Red Gladilious, also known as the Red Capes or the Red Knights were once Accecia’s most prestigious knightly brotherhood. Their oaths lay for the Kingdom and they fight for the people. THey fall under no house or banner. Their first and foremost duty is to protect the people. While you may think this would hinder their equipment and training. The Crown has actually officially recognized them as a knightly order and provided them with the necessary training and equipment. Ever since they’ve been the most well-trained fighting force the Kingdom of Accecia has seen. At the height of their might, they were 2,000 knights strong all deployed across the nation. But their famed stronghold, known as the Garden was lost to time and almost no one knows where it is. They were renowned for their honor, courage, chivalry, and true values. From what many old reports used to say, they never allowed criminals, unless they convicted youth who they openly brought in as squires who would soon be brought up as knights. They accepted knights of all status but most recruitees underwent a one year of trial where they must master not swordsmanship or have the best armor. But they must master, honor, courage, and humility. While yes, they do have pride being among the greatest warriors the realm has seen, they must hold that pride of a leash and put humility in its forefront. 
The trial of honor must have a knight do a deed that goes far beyond the expectations of who they are, something that goes beyond them, such as undergoing the time to help raise money or livestock. Blood must never be split by their blade during the trial. Courage seeks out doing things that are beyond simply fighting the toughest foe, some include fighting inner demons or traveling to painful pasts, righting wrongs, fixing broken relationships nor matter how painful, they do this to show that they are the strength that must plunge forward and must never have back of the head thoughts or past pains weigh them down, they must courageous. The trial of humility strips them of all titles as knights, their armor is to be sold no matter how expensive, their sword is to be smelted to help the common folk and they must live strictly as one of the people. They do this to remember who they are, while they are great knights they must show they are like the people, just people. A sign of humility to remind them who they fight for. 
Upon finishing all three trials, they are called to the Garden for their ceremonies and are reborn as Red Knights. And on their pauldrons is engraved their first Gladilious. Each time they accomplish something great such as partake in a massive defense or offensive, rank up in leadership or partake in an act so honorable, they are awarded more. 
The ranks partake the lowest ranking being regular Knights, soon followed by Senior knights, and Knight commanders
Watchman (or those who are entrusted with watching guard over the Red Outposts) are ranked as followed, Watchman, Lone watchman, watchman scouts, and Outpost commander 
The officer ranks go as Paladin, Senior Paladin, and Sentinal 
The highest rank of the knights goes to the Lord Commander or High Flower. 

Greatest Defeat
During the second scourge of the Lost Ones, the banners were called to dispose of the threat, though the Lost Ones had already made their way through many towns and cities, with scattered defenders doing their best to slow down the enemy for the better of the refugees. While the lords squabbled over who leads the vanguard, poltical disputes, and ties. The Crown immediately called upon the Red Knights to defend the Realm of Accecia, with no hesitation Master High Commander Sir Robin of Rock called upon all knights and sentinels to charge into battle. King Justin, leaving his only heir, rode with the Royal militia and guard (numbering 3,000) and the Knights of Red Gladilious marched to the now ruined farming valleys of the Greens. What they saw was what remained of the once-powerful House Hornwood’s fighters and battered militiamen number around (700). From there the royal army, the remnant fighters the Rd Knights set up. What came the following week was complete darkness. A horde of Lost Ones stormed the fortification, the last stand to buy time for the banners to rally. Day by day, more and more men fell the ground lay with the bodies of fallen royal soldiers and red knights. After 3 months of holding the line, what became of the once 5,700 defenders of the Course river bank was now a meager 1,200, mostly comprised of the King’s royal guard, the commander of the House Hornwood, Lord Castian Hornwood, and around 1000 Red Knights. Knowing what was to come, the King made a desperate decision. To charge the lines of the Lost One horde and reach the dark chasm. Many felt it was suicidal, but knew what needed to be done. As they setup for the charge. The banners of the realm of Accecia formed on the horizon and charged with their king. King Justin lead his men valiantly and plunged a casm into the ranks of the horde. Soon reaching the chasm with teh help of the banners. WIth no hesitation the battered king continued his charge determined to save the realm, his royal guard, and the Red knights followed. Plunging deep into the Lost One territory and eventually coming upon the cave of the Lost Ones. Sir Randal Oren was to lead a rearguard and defend the entrance while the other 900 men surged into the deep. Sir Randel Oren and his 100 held the entrance fiercely as they fought wave after wave, 1 Red Knight fell but not without striking 200 Lost Ones. Soon the horde dispersed. Sir Randel Oren and his remaining stormed the cave only to find the bodies of Red Knights littered acrss the cave entrance, deeper into the cave there lay the king with a sword in his chest, and Master High Commander Robin slain on he floor with trails of Red Knights scattered across the room. They had managed to fatally wound the Dark Heart the leader of the Lost Onesm temporarily erasing the army of existence. Sir Randel Oren and his company soon surged forward at the Dark Heart and slew it with a final stroke. They counted the dead, 900 dead Red Knights, a dead king and is royal guard. SIr Randel Oren and his company of only 50 knights emerged from the cave and were met with anger from the now young King. He blamed them for is father’s death. THe Red Knights under oath were to never raise their voice to the king and obliged to his order of disbanding the order at once. Now at the rein of King Justin the Second, the Red Knights are nothing but history, though few knights remain as vigilantes still defending the realm and upholding honor, some retired their title as Red Knights and continued their military career with their former houses, while SIr Randel ORen, now known as Randel the beggar ar reduced to nothing of what they once were. Now a new threat is emerging, the knights know it and Randel calls upon a young growing knight to attempt a call to all remaining knights to fight this known threat. 

The Awakening
After Sir Randel had managed to align the main character with the Red Knights, he brings him to the now ruined Garden. The 30 or so knights and squires that once served the Flower all cherished the memories they made. THough when they went into the flower bed, which represented the knights that were alive and had passed. Randel noticed that the 50 remaining knights had healthy flowers but instead of the fallen brethren he saw blackened flowers all emitting dark energy. Soon something alerts the knights and from the breached door stand 20 Red knights. With armor rusted and covered in dark magic, the voices distorted, and black magic seeping from the holes of their armor. Sir Randel saw this once before, the dark ones have taken the armor of the Red Knights and returned to finished what stopped them the first time. He instructs the mc to protect the archives while he and the remaining knights hold off the enemy. Upon slaying a dark one. Sir Randel heard the painful screams of his former comrade, Sir Brenden Mist screaming for help from the armor. Then a larger Lost one figure takes the fallen trooper and sucks the life force. And what they lay in front of Sir Randel was just the armor of his once alive comrade. The Dark Knights retreat into the unknown. Leaving the knights all mentally shattered. Sir Randel figured it out, the dark ones have held the souls of his comrades captive, bending and breaking their souls to serve the dark ones. But the good of the Red Knights broke through. He instructs the mc that the Lost Ones are active once again and instructs him that he must rally the banners and the crown once again. The Red Knights have another agenda, to free the trapped souls of their brethren. 
What are champions exactly?: Champions are chosen individuals that represent one of the core aspects of each god (in terms of writing I use the lowercase cuz Catholic :3) Each god has three distinct features (or wordings) that represent them 
Ex. Goddess of Penance: Represents Humility, Remorse, and Atonement 

Though not every god needs three champions (as one champion can be the embodiment of all three), it is very rare a mortal is able to impress a god enough of each piece the only example is the Goddess’ of Penance’s champion Meradon, who displayed each aspect of penance with near perfection, (it is also unusually special as the deity of penance was the only goddess to not choose a living champion in nearly 500 years) 

Champions will remain mortal but gain divine power/abilities that help turn the tide in their fights, though generally speaking the god’s do not take sides in mortal affairs. It is not uncommon that certain gods whose morals align with evil will generally give their champions more “freedom” this unfortunately causes disputes amongst champions and god’s where schisms and infighting happens where god’s eventually must choose a side. Also champions can be killed or gravely wounded albeit be able to recover quicker 

It does need to be mentioned that yes a champion’s alignment doesn't necessarily have to align directly with their god, as they can kinda derive 
Ex. Champion of Vengeance is more a chaotic neutral/chaotic goodest character who does his best (albeit violently) removes dark armies/soldiers but is often see as more of detriment due to his methods, even though his patron deity is often associated with evil and suffering, he fights in the name of vengeance to prevent that happened again 

Can god’s remove a champion’s powers?: yes and no, at will god’s CAN revoke their champion’s powers, however if a champion still embodies some aspect (even if their actions speak otherwise) the god cannot revoke their powers (divine laws etc etc, THATS FOR LATER) 

Currently in my story I plan to have at least 20 Champions  with 3 new ones as the story progresses (for at least the current book) and then have 5 of the original 20 die

Castius Riverbane: Eldest Prince of House of Riverbane
Execution style scene, the best fighters (including Lord Cliff) are all on execution line as Horus and Kestus watch from a tower. Riverbane is known to eliminate all houses ideologies and meaning, and Castius has a sadistic way of doing so. He makes his defeated enemies say the words of Riverbane, Let Blood Flow. In this scene in particular hes lining fighters from the united houses forcing them to say his words, some with less honor do so and are spared but not without losing a a body part (eye, hand, ear, leg etc etc) Those with honor to their houses say their words and as punishment, Castius painfully kills them (slowly stabbing them in eye, chest etc etc, throat) Horus and Kestus watch in complete horror as their closest friends are executed for their loyalty. Lord Cliff’s death (Horus’s father and a father figure to Kestus) is the most impactful. Insert crying scene for Kestus and Horus etc etc

General Story: 
The Second eldest of the Orion children 
Johan the eldest DAUGHTER of House Orion in an effort to prove herself that she isn’t just a noble lady, joins the Tournament of Blades a contest of swordsmenship of all types. The Tourney Master, Charlem, was once a proud member of House Keen but found the incredible art of swordsmanship from across the world. In doing so, for the first time he founded the great Tournement of Blades. However, denounce to Johan and the contestants, Charlem was the reason as to why House Keen fell to House Riverbane so easily, and he is in possession of the Artifacts of Riverbane, the family crest which he had infused as a tattoo. However, the crest requires an extreme amount of raw energy, with masters and warriors of all different swordsmanships/fighting styles, a plentiful amount was given. 
Behind the scenes, the crest requires many souls for energy, but it doesn’t take it only drains. Charlem aims to empower the crest with the soul energy of the many great fighters in teh arena, for every victory is bled energy of ecstasy, pride and valor, for every defeat, there is shame, jealousy, and hatred. The crest takes all 
However, the master of cutlasses, Norton Oldam catches wind of this and warns Johan as he knows who she is (plan is to have her hide her identify as an Orion) 
Together they devise a plan along with their companions (different champions) to stop Charlem from gaining more power 
Flowing Energy 
Energy flows in all living things, the roots etc etc explain how anger, love, pain, joy is spread through ones actions, hence it is released into the Earth again. 
Chanellers: powerful individuals who can manipulate their emotional and physic energy into powerful attacks allowing them to heal immensely or cause immense damage, a distant relative of House Orion has the ability to channel his emotional energy with astral energy creating a form unheard of which allows the Orion descendent to channel his emotional energy to be released and combined with astral energy 
Sea Voyage: 
Introduce Cutlass master, Lord of the Seven Lagoons 
Merritime Legend, Norton “Sails Master” Oldam 
As of now, the idea is to have 5 major pirate clans 
Clans 
Clan Oldam: Master of the seas, expert sailors 
Clan Crowley: Crafty, resourceful and some of the finest smugglers in all of the land 
Clan Tyde: expert marksman and masters of the guns, oddly enough not the most powerful, but they are second only to Hanzel 
Clan Stockard: masters of navigation, militarily the weakest of the clans, with only 5 active ships, however with masters of navigation most encounters end with the enemy lost in their midst 
Clan Hanzel: Master coinsman, wealthiest of all the clans, most powerful military (obviously, they could avidly afford it) 
General Story 
 The pirate clans oddly enough are descendents of noble houses originally from the land, with Clan Oldam being distant relatives to Clan Orion. However with Riverbane’s defeat, did not come with the forces loyal to said house istingiused. Following the harrowing discovery that Clan Riverbane used black magic in order to infuse the soul of Horace Riverbane into 5 powerful artifacts, the first one was to be found by the Delta Legion, a split faction of Riverbane that gained massive control over the waters of the Horacian Sea. Once ruled by noble houses is now a place without order. Except the pirate clans who actively raid snobby rich houses and are in constant fighting with the Delta. IT was 20 years after the defeat of House Riverbane, however the first artifact was found in the waters of he Horacian Sea, hidden away in an ancient Riverbane transport ship that was lost at sea. The eldest of the Orion children, Mason Orion was sent by his father to collect the first. Known as the Hand of Riverbane, was Riverbane’s generational sword. Mason must rally the pirate clans to the cause and help find it before the Delta do 
The Glade 
After the events at the Tournament of Blades and the Horacian Sea. It has become apparent to House Orion and the Coalition of Valor (the allied houses) that Riverbane’s influence is still a great threat, Aside from that word from houses from the North have sprung from the Glade. A place of permafrost and mysterious winds. And the oldest portions of civilization in the land. The third child of House Orion, Meldem was sent as envoy alongside an entourage of Orion solders. However, the Frost an entity of pure ice unleashes upon them killing all but 3. Meldem, his personal knight Sir Ostan Crez and Yolder. They are quickly saved by House Stag one of three major Houses in the Glade. 
Within the Glade lies three City States. Hjorstaden The city of stags, Fox’s Den, The City of Foxes of House Reynard, and Wolfspaw of House Howl. 
Once awakening he is informed of the Frost’s resurgence as a power in the GLade due to a warlock of House Riverbane taking another artifact into the heart of winter, the ring of Riverbane which fuels the frost. Now Meldam and the allies of the Glade must fight against teh Frost to retrieve it (revise this, this sounds boring asf) 
The Knight’s Redemption 
After a long slumber the Red Knights were once the most renowned knightly order in all of Accecia but during the first war with the Lost Ones an ancient entitiy that captures and weaponizes the souls of the slain. They lost their brotherhood due to a prideful king and now only a handful remain. However, the lost ones have surged again, unknown to the kingdoms forces, regardless the Royal Family and the Coalition of Valor have rallied their forces to fight the threat. However a local beggar known as Randel reveals to the next child Orion, Melissa that he was once part of the Red Knights and leads her and her group of knights to the ancient stronghold of the Red Knights. The Garden. With the knights reinvogarted in purpose they plunge forward as vigilantes to fight the lost ones again at its heart. 
They find that cultists who follow Riverbane went to the place of the Dark Heart to see if they could give life to the Crystalized Heart of Riverbane to reinvigorate it but in doing so, awoke the Lost Ones and they now terrorize the land 
This is why Meldam gets no help in the Glade as Accecia is plunged in the second Lost Ones crisis. 
The Evergreen 
 With the nation at war, House Orion sent their youngest under the ward and protection of the Scribes of Evergreen. However little known to them, a knight who “pledged” himself to the Evergreen had brought with him the armor of Riverbane and intends to use the powerful energy of the Evergreen to give life to it, offering his body as host. (Throughout the series, each artifact is collected and sent under the project of the Coalition’s United Fort) however an attack on the fort resulted in the artifacts stolen and now the final armor pieces are to be sent the evergreen. However Orion is as keen as ever. And with the help of

Meradon, He Who Refused the God’s Divinity
Ike Erikson, he was a pitfighter, not just A PITFIGHTER, he was Erikson’s idol and was one of the most well known pit fighters of all time. He gets his title of “he Who Refused the God’s Divinity” for quite simply refusing the power of the gods. Because of his prowess in combat he was offered divinity to become one of the champions, but refused it. The god’s punished him by removing the thing that caught their attention in the first place, his fists. However by chance he was offered by the masonry guild and the arcane guilds to be forged new fists. Those of which was enhanced by magic and special stone. From there he became even greater using his already godly combat prowess to be able to challenge the champions themselves 
Instance where he ends up fighting Erikson, Erikson still cocky as ever due to his now found abilities as the Champion of Penance decides to challenge Meradon to a sparring match, a grave mistake. In short, the more experienced pitfighter easily pummels the newfound champion stating “The storm of the ring eh? Didn’t feel as much as droplet from you”. (Eventually, Meradon becomes Erikson’s mentor) 
The Goddess of death: Instead of being terrifying or like of eldritch horro, Death is represented by an old lady, whos actually on the good side, she is a representation of one who accepts death. 
The Harbinger of Retribution: a legend amongst all the factions of Accecia. It is said that if any of sides commit any heinous crime, the Harbinger is said to come and collect their souls, no army, no knight and not even the Champions can stop the Harbinger. If you do wrong, be wary of your limited days.
